Assessment for Machine Learning Module using Boston Housing Dataset

## Installation and Running

This project was run on Pyhton version: 3.6.3 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, Oct 15 2017, 03:27:45) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)]
This can be downloaded and installed on https://www.anaconda.com/<br>

The data is presented on a Jupyter Notebook.
Jupyter can be downloaded on http://jupyter.org/install. * note downloading python first is a prerequisite.<br>

Keras is used for data modelling.
More information about keras and how to install from the command line can be found on https://keras.io/

## The Keras Model

I found it difficult to find suitable variations of the model to improve prediction error. There are so many options using the keras package that although these are fun to use the simple act of adding a few neurons to the layer can change the results dramatically!:grinning: Even after trying different standardising optionsthe results could vary considerably using the same model for each run.<br> There are quite alot of activation options and I found relu was the most consistent
